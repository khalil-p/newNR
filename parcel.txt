parcel is a bundler and its a beast

~ install major update
^ install minor update


what is package.json?
    its a configuration for npm . it keeps track of what version of packages are installed 

what is this package-lock.json ?
    package-lock.json will keep the track of the exact version of the package being installed

every dependency in node module have its own package.json and package-lock.json


parcel install many other dependencies such as babel , browserslist

just like we have npm we have npx - npx means excicuting the package

what parcel does?
- dev build ==> parcel gives you faster development experience / build because it is cashing things up in `parcelCash`
- local server
- hmr ==> parcel uses file watching algorithm that is written c++
- image optimization ==> parcel does image optimization
- cashing - faster builds
- ImageOptimization
- Bundling
- Compressing
- Consistant Hashing 
- Code Splitting
- Differential Bundeling - to support older browsers
- Diagnostic
- Error Handling
- HTTPS - Parcel also gives you to run your server on https://
- Tree Shaking algoritm - Parcel will remove unused code 



Episode 2 :: Assignments :

[1] What is .parcel-cache ?
Answer : 
The `.parcel-cache` directory is a cache folder created by the **Parcel bundler**. It is used to store intermediate build data and processed assets, which helps speed up subsequent builds by avoiding the need to reprocess files that haven't changed.

### Key Features of `.parcel-cache`
1. **Build Performance**: 
   - By caching previously processed assets and build outputs, Parcel can avoid repeating expensive operations, significantly reducing build times.
   
2. **Incremental Builds**:
   - Parcel uses the cached data to determine which files have changed and only processes those files, making incremental builds faster.

3. **Storage of Intermediate Artifacts**:
   - Includes parsed modules, transformed code, optimized images, and other precomputed data.

4. **Automatic Management**:
   - The cache is automatically managed by Parcel and can be deleted if needed. Parcel will recreate the cache when you run the build process again.

### Should You Keep `.parcel-cache`?
- **In Development**: Yes, you should keep it to benefit from faster builds.
- **In CI/CD Pipelines**: You can delete it if you want a fresh build, but caching it between builds (e.g., using CI caching mechanisms) can significantly speed up build times.
- **In Version Control**: It should **not** be committed to version control (e.g., Git). Add it to your `.gitignore` file.

### How to Clear `.parcel-cache`?
If you encounter issues related to stale or corrupted cache, you can safely delete the `.parcel-cache` directory:
- Run `parcel clean` (if available in your setup).
- Or manually delete the `.parcel-cache` directory.

Parcel will regenerate it the next time you build the project.

[2] What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?
Answer:
### What is Parcel and Webpack?

Both **Parcel** and **Webpack** are **module bundlers** used in modern web development. Their primary function is to bundle multiple assets (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.) into a format optimized for browsers.

---

### **Parcel**
- **Overview**:
  - A zero-configuration bundler known for its ease of use.
  - Automatically infers configuration from your project structure.
  - Focuses on fast builds with caching and incremental compilation.

- **Key Features**:
  1. **Zero Configuration**: No setup is required for most cases.
  2. **Fast Builds**: Uses caching and parallel processing to optimize speed.
  3. **Built-in Support**: Handles modern JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, CSS, images, and more out-of-the-box.
  4. **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Updates the browser instantly during development without a full reload.

---

### **Webpack**
- **Overview**:
  - A highly configurable and versatile bundler.
  - Offers a more hands-on, detailed approach for advanced use cases.
  - Often used with additional tools (like Babel or loaders) for maximum flexibility.

- **Key Features**:
  1. **Customizability**: Highly customizable through a `webpack.config.js` file.
  2. **Plugins and Loaders**: Supports a wide array of plugins and loaders for transforming and optimizing files.
  3. **Code Splitting**: Splits code into smaller chunks for optimized delivery.
  4. **Tree Shaking**: Removes unused code for smaller builds.

---

### Why Do We Need Parcel or Webpack?

1. **Module Bundling**:
   - Browsers donâ€™t understand modern JavaScript features like `import`/`export` natively. Bundlers combine all your modules into a single file (or smaller chunks) for browsers.

2. **Asset Optimization**:
   - Compresses and optimizes images, minifies CSS/JavaScript, and performs tree-shaking to remove unused code.

3. **Improved Development Workflow**:
   - Features like Hot Module Replacement (HMR) let you see changes instantly without refreshing the browser.

4. **Compatibility**:
   - Transpiles modern JavaScript (e.g., ES6+) to ensure compatibility with older browsers.

5. **Performance**:
   - Outputs optimized files for faster load times in production.

6. **Advanced Features**:
   - Enables features like lazy loading, code splitting, and dynamic imports for better performance and maintainability.

---

### **When to Use Which?**
- Use **Parcel** if:
  - You prefer minimal setup and quick development.
  - You are working on small to medium-sized projects.

- Use **Webpack** if:
  - You need fine-grained control over your build process.
  - You are working on a large project with complex requirements.

Both tools are widely used and have their strengths, but the choice depends on the project complexity and your workflow preferences.
