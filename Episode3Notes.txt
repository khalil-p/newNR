#JSX
- jsx is not the part of React
- jsx is not html inside JavaScript
- jsx is a html like syntax or xml like
- jsx is just a syntax
- Element created using jsx in react is an object


Element created using react :
const heading = React.createElement("h1",{id:"heading"},"This is heading")

Element created using JSX:
const heading = <h1>This is heading</h1>

These two objects are one and the same thing

JS Engine cannot read JSX . Then how does this is read by the browser ? the ansser is parcel.
- The jsx with JavaScript is transpiled (this code is converted to the code that the browsers can understand) by the parcel before it goes to JS Engine.
- And Parcel does not transpile itself it uses `Babel` to do this.
- Babel is a JavaScript compiler / transpiler.
- Babel is not created by facebook.
- JSX ==> React.createElement ==> JS object ==> HTML render
- To give the attribute in JSX use camelCasing (eg: class => className, tabindex=>tabIndex)
- if the jsx is in single line the ok
        const headingJsx = <h2 id="heading">This is heading</h2>;
 but if it is in multiple line then wrap it inside `( )`

        const headingJsx = (<h2 id="heading">This is heading</h2>
                            <h2 id="heading">This is heading</h2>
                            )

React Component :

Every thing in react is a Component and react functions Component are simple js functions

there are two types of components :
[1] Class based components - old way
[2] Functional components - new way => react functions Component are simple js function which return some jsx

-first letter should be capital

const HeadingComponent = () => {
  return <h1 id="heading">This is heading</h1>;
};

root.render(<HeadingComponent/>);

- To put a component inside the component is called as `COMPONENT COMPOSITION`

- you can write any JavaScript code / expression inside JSX using `{}`
example :

const HeadingComponent =() =>{
    return 
    (
        <>
            {console.log("this is js exporession", 1+2)}
            <h1 id="heading">This is heading</h1>;
        </>
    )

}


## Getting Data from API
-If api is cought by api and the api send some malecious data i.e `Cross site Scripting` happens then JSX takes care of 
 these type of malicious attacks
